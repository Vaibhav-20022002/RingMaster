## Key Observations

1.  **Adaptive Strategy Effectiveness**:
    - The new spin-then-block strategy is highly effective at managing contention without wasting CPU. The number of actual blocking events is extremely low (typically **< 0.01%**), meaning the initial spin phase successfully handles the vast majority of wait scenarios.
    - This represents a major improvement in CPU efficiency over the previous busy-wait approach.

2.  **Throughput/Bandwidth Profile**:
    - **Small items (4-64B)**: Throughput is lower than the pure busy-wait strategy. The overhead of the mutex and the high latency of kernel-level context switching (when blocking occurs) are significant compared to the fast memory copy.
    - **Large items (1KB+)**: Performance is memory-bound, peaking at **~20 GB/s**. The throughput is nearly identical to the old strategy.

3.  **Contention Behavior**:
    - **Spinning**: The "Spin %" indicates the frequency of contention. Pop spins increase with element size as the consumer waits for the producer's larger memory copy to complete.
    - **Blocking**: The "Block %" shows how often contention is prolonged. The low values confirm the adaptive approach is working as intended, only resorting to an expensive OS wait when absolutely necessary.

4.  **Efficiency Patterns**:
    - Peak efficiency (items processed per microsecond) now occurs at **16 bytes (21.77 items/µs)** with `-O3`.
    - The trade-off for CPU safety is a lower peak items/µs efficiency compared to the old strategy, which achieved its numbers by consuming an entire CPU core.

5.  **Compiler Optimization Impact**:
    - High optimization levels (`-O2`, `-O3`) are crucial for performance.
    - `-O3` shows a slight edge for most element sizes with the new waiting logic, particularly for small to medium-sized elements.

## Conclusions
1.  **The adaptive strategy is a success**, providing a robust balance between low-latency spinning and high-efficiency blocking.
2.  **Optimal optimization level is now primarily O3** for best performance with the new waiting mechanism.
3.  **16-byte elements** achieve the best throughput and efficiency (~22M items/s).
4.  **>1KB elements** are memory-bound. Contention is high, but it is handled efficiently by blocking rather than wasting CPU cycles.
5.  The implementation maintains **100% data accuracy** while being a much better "citizen" in a multi-tasking OS environment.

> **Recommendation**: For most applications, the new `push_wait`/`pop_wait` methods provide the best balance of performance and system efficiency. For latency-critical paths, 16-32B elements with `-O3` optimization are recommended. For bandwidth-heavy workloads, the performance is limited by DRAM speed, and the new strategy ensures this happens without unnecessary CPU load.
